# Interview Contact Us Form

Hi Candidate!

This is a demo "Contact Us" form for interview candidates to improve in several ways after we have mangled it to perfection.

## Setup

Create a test Ethereal Email account at `https://ethereal.email/` and load those details into `.env`.

Then run:

```js
1. npm install
2. npm run start-app
```

and access the application at `http://localhost:3030/`


## Your tasks
Below are a list of suggested improvements, you are ***not expected to make all*** the suggested improvements within the code but we ***do expect you to complete more than one***.

Choose an improvement to make and complete it such that the form is still rendered out completely i.e. you do not introduce bugs that cause the form to fail to render and we just have a white screen to stare at. We will be assessing it within a browser environment and in your interview, so presentation definitely helps here.

For those suggested improvements that you **do not** make in the code, we want you to think about ***how*** you would make the improvements - we will be covering each improvement area in the interview - so be prepared and consider the improvements altogether and their solutions.

## Suggested Improvements

1. The form renders well on mobile, tablets and desktops.
2. The form validates a customer's request.
3. The form guards customers against attacks.
4. The form guards the Trust against attacks.
5. The use of more third party libraries.
6. Better code layout.
7. Application has automated tests.
8. Email send to Trust is replaced with a database system.


## ...
We're looking forward to how you apply the improvements and then you talking about them with us.
